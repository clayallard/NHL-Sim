# NHL-Sim

Background:
In order to understand the project, I must give background to how the NHL works. In general, for there is a regular season and a playoffs. In the regular season, a team gets 2 points for a win, 1 point for losing in overtime, and 0 points for losing in regulation. The goal is to have as many points as possible to make the playoffs. In the playoffs, there are 16 teams that participate. Each round, teams will matchup in a best of 7 seven series. I have also written the code so that I could robustly adapt these settings if I want to, but for the sake of presentation, I will just focus on how it works in real life. My simulation is based on the 2021 COVID shortened season format, but when I get the chance, I will make this simulation for the 2022 season format (which will probably be the format for the next several years with the Seattle Kraken entering the league as a new team). For now, I will explain the season format of both the the 2021 and 2022 season even though I have only implemented the 2021 season format. I have also implemented my own made up formats as well, but I won't go into detail about those (maybe when I have time and feel like it). 

  2021
There 31 teams in the league and four divisions. There are 3 divisions of 8 teams (west, central, east) and one division of 7 teams (the Canada division). There are 56 games in total for each team. Teams will only play within their own division. This is due to COVID restrictions where teams in Canada couldn't consistently cross the border. The top four teams in each division make the playoffs.


Summary:
This project is a simulation of NHL seasons. A model of randomness that determines the outcome of any amount of seasons. The basic idea is that every team is given a number to represent how "good" they are. Then teams are matched up against eachother and the probability of either team winning
